	INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROJECT 

In research, working in groups is a key to success. Research is an activity performed in teams.  This is your chance to learn how to overcome the challenges of working in a team in order to achieve a common goal.  This project gives you the opportunity to experience all phases of the research process.   The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

1.	Find a product and/or service that targets college students.  It can be a new product/service or an existing one.  You cannot, however, invent a product/service.  It has to be one in existence. 

2.	The product/service needs to be one that experiences competition from other products/services.

3.	Do a background search about it to learn about its provider/manufacturer and other important aspects of it and the general category of products/services to which it belongs.

4.	Assume for the sake of this assignment that the product manufacturer or service provider has hired you.  Your mission is to develop a study that measures important dimensions of the users or nonusers of this product or service.

5.	The purpose of this study is to report to the product manufacturer or service provider competitive intelligence about the product and/or service.  Key information here includes college students' level of awareness about its existence, usage or non-usage motivations, usage patterns, satisfaction with product and/or service and comparative trends with competing products or services and other relevant attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.
